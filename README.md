# ReSTL
Code to reproduce simulations

The following are general functions used for ReST-L or T-RL: general_functions; restl_functions; trl_functions

The following functions can be used to generate data presented in Section 4.1 (and applicable simulations presented in the supplementary information): twoStage2; twoStage2_nontree

The following functions can be used to generate data presented in Section 4.2: oneStage; oneStage_nontree

The following functions can be used to generate data presented in Section 4.3 (and applicable simulations presented in the supplementary information): twoStage; twoStage_nontree

The csv file includes the patients identifers (IDs) and the respective ICU IDs for the analysis cohort used in the data application.
